        Name of the Play: An Enemy of the People

    <h5>Dr. Stockmann</h5>
    <p>(laughing and rubbing his hands)</p>
    <p>She didn't dare do otherwise, either! It's delicious!</p>
    <h5>Mrs. Stockmann</h5>
    <p>Well, after the dreadful scenes last night—</p>
    <h5>Petra</h5>
    <p>It was not only that. Just listen to this, father!</p>
    <h5>Dr. Stockmann</h5>
    <p>Well?</p>
    <h5>Petra</h5>
    <p>Mrs. Busk showed me no less than three letters she received this morning—</p>
    <h5>Dr. Stockmann</h5>
    <p>Anonymous, I suppose?</p>
    <h5>Petra</h5>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    <h5>Dr. Stockmann</h5>
    <p>Yes, because they didn't dare to risk signing their names, Katherine!</p>
    <h5>Petra</h5>
    <p>And two of them were to the effect that a man, who has been our guest here, was declaring last night at
        the Club that my views on various subjects are extremely emancipated—</p>
    <h5>Dr. Stockmann</h5>
    <p>You did not deny that, I hope?</p>
    <h5>Mrs. Stockmann</h5>
    <p>And someone who had been a guest of ours! That shows you the return you get for your
        hospitality, Thomas!</p>
    <h5>Dr. Stockmann</h5>
    <p>We won't live in such a disgusting hole any longer. Pack up as quickly as you can, Katherine; the
        sooner we can get away, the better.</p>
    <h5>Mrs. Stockmann</h5>
    <p>Be quiet—I think I hear someone in the hall. See who it is, Petra.</p>
    <h5>Petra</h5>
    <p>(opening the door)</p>
    <p> Oh, it's you, Captain Horster! Do come in.</p>
    <h5>Horster</h5>
    <p>Good morning. I thought I would just come in and see how you were.</p>
    <h5>Dr. Stockmann</h5>
    <p>(shaking his hand)</p>
    <p> Thanks—that is really kind of you.</p>
    <h5>Mrs. Stockmann</h5>
    <p>And thank you, too, for helping us through the crowd, Captain Horster.</p>
    <h5>Petra</h5>
    <p>How did you manage to get home again?</p>
    <h5>Horster</h5>
    <p>Oh, somehow or other. I am fairly strong, and there is more sound than fury about these folk.</p>
    <h5>Dr. Stockmann</h5>
    <p>Yes, isn't their swinish cowardice astonishing? Look here, I will show you something! There are
        all the stones they have thrown through my windows. Just look at them!</p>
    <p>I'm hanged if there are more than two decently large bits of hard stone in the whole heap; the rest are nothing
        but gravel—wretched little things. And
        yet they stood out there bawling and swearing that they would do me some violence; but as for doing anything—you
        don't see much of that in this town.</p>
    <h5>Horster</h5>
    <p>Just as well for you this time, doctor!</p>
    <h5>Dr. Stockmann</h5>
    <p>True enough. But it makes one angry all the same; because if some day it should be a question of
        a national fight in real earnest, you will see that public opinion will be in favour of taking to one's heels,
        and the compact majority will turn tail like a flock of sheep, Captain Horster. That is what is so mournful to
        think of; it gives me so much concern, that—. No, devil take it, it is ridiculous to care about it! They have
        called me an enemy of the people, so an enemy of the people let me be!</p>
    <h5>Mrs. Stockmann</h5>
    <p>You will never be that, Thomas.</p>
    <h5>Dr. Stockmann</h5>
    <p>Don't swear to that, Katherine. To be called an ugly name may have the same effect as a
        pin-scratch in the lung. And that hateful name—I can't get quit of it. It is sticking here in the pit of my
        stomach, eating into me like a corrosive acid. And no magnesia will remove it.</p>
    <h5>Petra</h5>
    <p>Bah!—you should only laugh at them, father,</p>
    <h5>Horster</h5>
    <p>They will change their minds some day, Doctor.</p>
    <h5>Mrs. Stockmann</h5>
    <p>Yes, Thomas, as sure as you are standing here.</p>
    <h5>Dr. Stockmann</h5>
    <p>Perhaps, when it is too late. Much good may it do them! They may wallow in their filth then and
        rue the day when they drove a patriot into exile. When do you sail, Captain Horster?</p>
    <h5>Horster</h5>
    <p>Hm!—that was just what I had come to speak about—</p>
    <h5>Dr. Stockmann</h5>
    <p>Why, has anything gone wrong with the ship?</p>
    <h5>Horster</h5>
    <p>No; but what has happened is that I am not to sail in it.</p>
    <h5>Petra</h5>
    <p>Do you mean that you have been dismissed from your command?</p>
    <h5>Horster</h5>
    <p>(smiling)</p>
    <p>Yes, that's just it.</p>
    <h5>Petra</h5>
    <p>You too.</p>
    <h5>Mrs. Stockmann</h5>
    <p>There, you see, Thomas!</p>
    <h5>Dr. Stockmann</h5>
    <p>And that for the truth's sake! Oh, if I had thought such a thing possible—</p>
